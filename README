Apache configuration for HP Demo Simple apache2 (w32) config and app for demonstrating load balancing tags

This is a the config for the apache on a W32 instance, includes the .so modules to support the LoadBalancer fconfig. apache config set to build in C:\apache24 \bin \conf \modules ...

Load C:\data\apache-config\ 
	conf\ 
		site1.conf 
		site2.conf 
		site3.conf
		loadbalancer.conf 
	site-1\ 
	site-2\ 
	site-3#
	default-site\

Directives to change if paths change: site1.conf & site2.conf have directives:

Directory \data\site?

and

ErrorLog \data\apache-config\logs\site?.log CustomLog \data\apache-config\logs\site?_access.log common

LoadBalancer.conf contains: ErrorLog \data\apache-config\logs\mycluster.log CustomLog \data\apache-config\logs\mycluster_access.log common

These need to be changed to their absolute paths.

The main apache2 config file in "apache install directory"\conf\httpd.conf ServerRoot "\Apache24"
and 

include c:\data\apache-config\conf\*.conf

which need changing the their new install absolute paths.


Note: Downloading the .msi apache2 pachage was found to not include all of the files of the proxy_mod needed to make the solution work. By all means try this. Also linux supporters can use the base config to set up a linux scenario. Mind that the relevant modules are correctly specified and loaded into the apache config
